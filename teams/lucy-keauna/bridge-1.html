<h2> Design process </h2>
    <h3>It was a very narrow bridge. </h3>

<h3> <span style="background-color: #debbea">  Measurments: <div class="HELLO"></div>  </h3> 
        <h4> - length: 60cm </h4>
        <div> <h4> - hight: 15cm </h4></div> 
    <div> <h4>- width: 5cm</h4> </div> 
      <div> <h4>
          Our thoughts were that if we had a thin bridge we would have leftover spagetti for extra support. But that did not work.  

For the next test we have lots of new ideas and strategies to make test #2 better than the last. </h4></div>

<div><h3> Problem</h3></div>
<p><span style="background-color: #debbea">-Off balance / too tippy</span> <div> </div> </p>
<span style="background-color: #debbea"> -Not wide enough </span>
 <div> <h3> Results </h3></div>
Sadly our bridge broke while we were finishing it up on the day of the crushing.

<div> <h3>Reflections and improvement </h3></div>
We have defenitly learnt that wide bridges are better than narrow.
<div>- Making sure the top is leveled </div>
 <p> <div> - Most of all we will try to avoid getting disqualifyed </p> </div>
